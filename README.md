# Stock Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project 
A Finance degree holder, Steve, who wanted to assist his parents make the right decision regarding which  green energy stock to invest in used VBA for his analysis. His parents without much research, had decided to invest all their money in DAQO New Energy Corp stock. An Excel file that contained a handful of green energy stock data including that of DAQO New Energy Corp was analyzed by steve. He used the extension to excel, VBA, for his analysis so that the analysis could be automated and reused with any stock data. After his analysis, the result was that DAQO New Energy Corp had a return of 1.99 in 2017 and a return of -0.63 in 2018.

### Purpose

In this project,the existing VBA code that was created by steve to help determine which green energy stock his parents should invest in will be refactored. Refactoring the code will allow the VBA Macro to run more efficiently. That is,it will be able to run thousands of stocks while using just a short time to execute. The goal here is to make it possible to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years while running in a short amount of time.  


## Results

From the analysis, the stock performance of 2017 was better than the performance for 2018. 
When the original code steve created was run it took about 0.93 seconds to run the code for the year 2018 and about 0.98 seconds to run the code for the year 2017. 

## Summary 
What are the advantages or dusadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring makes the code easier to read and understand. It helps to run the code faster . It makes the code reusable
It helps to improve the functionality of the code and makes it more reliable.

if not carefully done it could introduce new bugs or errors into the code 
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original vba script
